Carbon Foot  Print Of Main AI algorithms

This project main goal is to study the potential Carbon Foot Print of main AI algorithms.

Our first goal to exploit arxiv API, to do so.

Here is our first plan :

1) Study arxvy AI Papers 

2) Provide a library to get information about the carbon foot print of main AI algorithms.
